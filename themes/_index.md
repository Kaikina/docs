# Themes

The default PrestaShop installation offers the neutral "Classic theme", enabling merchants to quickly and freely start their activity, whatever their business line.

Several marketplaces are available to get PrestaShop themes. As a graphic designer/front developer, you can put your themes up for sale on these marketplaces.
