Testing
=======

Creating tests is an important part of a module life. They allow us to spend less time on reviews, prevent redundant checks that could be missed by a human, and at the same time improve the overall quality of the code.

In PrestaShop, we plan to cover our modules features with a bundle of unit and functional tests. We let you chose what frameworks suits you the best, but we provide some tools that you can reuse on your projects.
